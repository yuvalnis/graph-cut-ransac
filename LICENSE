This project implements a hybrid RANSAC framework for planar affine rectification
from local change of scale and orientation, and is based on the Graph-Cut RANSAC
algorithm. The code is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License.

(https://github.com/danini/graph-cut-ransac). The modifications adapt the
original implementation to support estimation of a single model using multiple
feature classes in a hybrid fashion.
